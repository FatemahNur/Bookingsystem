# Booking System

This is a simple booking system implemented in Java. It allows users to make bookings, view all bookings, and cancel bookings. The system consists of three main classes:

Booking: Represents a booking with properties like ID, customer name, booking date, and number of guests.

BookingSystem: Manages the bookings by providing methods to make a booking, get all bookings, get a booking by ID, and cancel a booking.

BookingSystemUI: Provides a simple command-line interface for users to interact with the booking system. Users can choose options like making a booking, viewing all bookings, canceling a booking, and exiting the program.

To run the program, simply compile all the Java files and run the BookingSystemUI class. Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the menu options.

# Getting Started
